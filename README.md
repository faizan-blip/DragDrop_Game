I HAVE A CREATED USING REACT JS FULL RESPONSIVE WEBSITE WITH USER INTERFACE GLASSMORPHISM DESIGN WHERE I CREATED A COMPONENTS OF NAVBAR AND DRAG, BASICALLY NAVBAR. JS IS A GAME LANDING PAGE WITH ANIMATON AND DRAG. JS IS THE GAME MAIN PAGE WHERE I USE THE HTML5 API DRAG AND DROP FEATURE TO SORT THE NUMBER WITH SOME FRAMER MOTION. AND THESE COMPONENTS WERE ROUTED IN THE APP.JS PAGE.
